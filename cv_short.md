#### Research and Development

I am Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science,
University of Copenhagen, where I am also Center Manager for the
HIPERFIT Research Center, which, with special attention to the finance
industry, focuses on solving problems within the domains of
high-performance computing and big data.

I conduct research related to the design and implementation of
high-level programming languages. My research interests cover
the areas of data-parallel programming languages, module systems, platforms and type systems for Web
applications, program optimisation, type systems for static memory
management, transient fault tolerant computing, garbage collection
techniques, and instruction selection for virtual machines and
different microprocessors, including the x86 microprocessor. I have
also done work in the area of constraint-based program analyses.

#### Teaching

I have taught a large number of courses, including general
introductory courses on programming, on web-programming and databases,
and courses on more advanced classes related to parallel programming,
program analysis, and program optimisation.

I have supervised a high number of M.Sc. thesis students, B.Sc. thesis
students, and other projects. The projects have covered blockchain
technology, compiler technology, type systems, and the development,
documentation, and testing of Web-based and traditional GUI-style,
database-enabled, systems in Java, C#, PHP, TCL, Haskell, and Standard
ML. I am currently supervising two Ph.D. students within areas
coverered by HIPERFIT. One PhD student has graduated.

#### Organisational Work

From May 2009 to 2012, I worked as Team Leader in the Instrument
Modeling Language team at SimCorp. From August 2007 to May 2008, I
served as the head of the international technical ITU program Software
Development and Technology. From November 2003 to January 2005, I
served as Head of the ITU Internet and Software Technology Study
Program. During 2004, I have attended a management course at SHL
Denmark. During the educational year 2001-2002, I have attended a
pedagogical education program for assistant professors at KVL, in
addition to a course on project supervision. I have been a
co-organiser of the DIKU International Summer School on Region-Based
Memory Management, August 18-22, 1997, held at the University of
Copenhagen, Denmark. I have reviewed papers for a series of
conferences, workshops, and journals, including PLDI'96, PLILP'96,
IFL'97, POPL'97, SAS'97, PLDI'99, ESOP'01, ESOP'03, HOSC, JFP, and
TOPLAS. I have served on the programme committees for the 2008
International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC'08), the 2007
Nordic Workshop on Secure IT Systems (NordSec'07), the 2005 ACM
SIGPLAN Workshop on ML (ML'05), held in Tallinn, Estonia, September
2005, on ARRAY'2017, and on ICFP'18. I have also served as programme co-chair for
the 2006 ACM Workshop on Semantics, Program Analysis, and Computing
Environments for Memory Management (SPACE'06), held in South Carolina,
January 2006 and for the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN 3rd International Workshop
on Libraries, Languages and Compilers for Programming (ARRAY'2016).
