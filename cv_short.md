#### Research and Development

I am Professor in the Programming Languages and Theory of Computation
section at the Department of Computer Science, University of
Copenhagen, where I serve as head of the <a
href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/pltc/">PLTC Section</a> and
head of studies for the BSc education on Computer Science and
Economics.

Until 2018, I served as Center Manager for the
HIPERFIT Research Center, which, with special attention to the finance
industry, focused on solving problems within the domains of
high-performance computing and big data.

I conduct research related to the design and implementation of high-level
programming languages. My research interests cover the areas of data-parallel
programming languages, module systems, platforms and type systems for Web
applications, program optimisation, type systems for static memory management,
transient fault tolerant computing, garbage collection techniques, and
instruction selection for virtual machines and different microprocessors,
including the x86 microprocessor. I have also done work in the area of
constraint-based program analyses and recently, I have been involved in research
in quantum circuit simulation.

#### Teaching

I have taught a large number of courses, including general introductory courses
on programming, on web-programming and databases, and courses on more advanced
classes related to parallel programming, quantum programming languages, program
analysis, and program optimisation.

I have supervised a high number of M.Sc. thesis students, B.Sc. thesis students,
and other projects. The projects have covered areas such as financial
engineering (e.g., portfolio optimation theory, OTC contracts, risk-analyses),
blockchain technology, compiler technology, type systems, and the development of
Web-based and traditional GUI-style, database-enabled, systems in Java, C#, PHP,
TCL, Haskell, and Standard ML. I have successfully supervised three Phd
students.

#### Organisational Work

From May 2009 to 2012, I worked as Team Leader in the Instrument Modeling
Language team at SimCorp. From August 2007 to May 2008, I served as the head of
the international technical ITU program Software Development and
Technology. From November 2003 to January 2005, I served as Head of the ITU
Internet and Software Technology Study Program. During 2004, I attended a
management course at SHL Denmark. During the educational year 2001-2002, I
attended a pedagogical education program for assistant professors at KVL, in
addition to a course on project supervision. I have been a co-organiser of the
DIKU International Summer School on Region-Based Memory Management, August
18-22, 1997, held at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. I have reviewed
papers for a series of conferences, workshops, and journals, including PLDI'96,
PLILP'96, IFL'97, POPL'97, SAS'97, PLDI'99, ESOP'01, ESOP'03, HOSC, JFP, and
TOPLAS. I have served on the programme committees for the 2008 International
Conference on Compiler Construction (CC'08), the 2007 Nordic Workshop on Secure
IT Systems (NordSec'07), the 2005 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML (ML'05), held in
Tallinn, Estonia, September 2005, on ARRAY'2017, and on ICFP '18, '24. I have
also served as programme co-chair for the 2006 ACM Workshop on Semantics,
Program Analysis, and Computing Environments for Memory Management (SPACE'06)
and for the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN 3rd International Workshop on Libraries, Languages
and Compilers for Programming (ARRAY'2016).
