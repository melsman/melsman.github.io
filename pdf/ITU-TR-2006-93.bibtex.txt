  ABSTRACT = {We analyze the matching problem for bigraphs. In
                  particular, we present an axiomatization of the
                  static theory of \emph{binding bigraphs}, a
                  non-trivial extension of the axiomatization of pure
                  bigraphs developed by Milner. Based directly on the
                  term language resulting from the axiomatization we
                  present a sound and complete inductive
                  characterization of matching of binding bigraphs.
                  Our results pave the way for an actual matching
                  algorithm, as needed for an implementation of
                  bigraphical reactive systems.}
