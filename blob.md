Martin Elsman conducts research in the design and implementation of
programming languages. Areas of research include domain-specific
languages for financial contracts and compilation techniques for
functional languages, in particular with focus on data-parallel
languages, module systems, Web technology, program analyses for memory
management, and program optimisation. Martin is Professor in the
Programming Languages and Theory of Computation section at Department
of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (DIKU), where he serves
as head of studies for a BSc education on Computer Science and
Economics. Martin is also an active maintainer of several software
tools, including the MLKit, a full-blown Standard ML compiler, which
targets both JavaScript and x86-64 machine code. Before joining DIKU
in 2012, Martin spent four years in [SimCorp](http://www.simcorp.com)
developing software, using functional programming techniques, for
specifying and managing financial contracts. Before his time at
SimCorp, Martin was Associate Professor at the IT University of
Copenhagen.  For more information, see
